Q2 – Guess The Number

Design and implement a program that plays a "Guess the Number" game:

• The program randomly selects a number between 1 and 1000.
• The player has up to 10 attempts to guess the correct number.
• After each guess, the program provides feedback:
    - “Too High, Try Again” if the guess is higher than the target.
    - “Too Low, Try Again” if the guess is lower than the target.
• When the number is guessed:
    - If guessed in fewer than 10 tries: display a special success message.
    - If guessed in exactly 10 tries: display a different success message.
• If the number is not guessed within 10 attempts: display a message encouraging better performance next time.

Additional requirements:
• Create both a console version and a GUI version of the application.
• For the GUI, use an input field for guesses, display messages in the interface, and provide a way to reset and start a new game.
• Implement efficient guessing strategies, allowing the player to logically narrow the range with each attempt.
