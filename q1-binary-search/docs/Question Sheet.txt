Assessment 3 - Binary Search of an Unordered Array

Question 1

Extend and modify the code from the lectures on Binary Search of an ordered array to do the following:

1. The program must accept an array of 14 strings (not in order):

   "Jon", "Dot", "Eva", "Roy", "Guy", "Jan", "Tom", "Jim", "Ann", "Kim", "Ron", "Tim", "Kay", "Amy"

2. Now use a suitable sorting algorithm to sort the array.
   You must call on your knowledge of strings as well (e.g., rewrite Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, Selection Sort to deal with strings and incorporate it into your solution).

3. Now adjust your binary search of an ordered array code to allow the user to enter a string and establish its position in the ordered array if it exists.

Here is a version that I mocked up in Java. You may use C++, or you may like to try C#.


Question 2

The following exercise will use the principles that you have learned in the Binary Search of an Ordered Array lectures.

Program chooses the number to be guessed by selecting a random integer between 1 and 1000.

The application displays the prompt:

    Guess a number between 1 and 1000

The user has a maximum of 10 guesses to figure out the number. The user types a guess and presses ENTER.

If the guess is incorrect, the application displays either:

    Too High, Try Again

    OR

    Too Low, Try Again

...and waits for another guess.

When the user guesses the number correctly, one of the following messages will appear:
